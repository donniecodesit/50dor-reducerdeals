## About This App
React project made during Day 28 of "50 Days of React" by Sufa Digital Media on Udemy.
This application is a mock shopping cart application, which is very similar to prior practices, but was a great refresher and practice on using useReducer and useContext hooks in react, instead of relying on messy and scattered useState hooks.
